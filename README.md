# CTF Writeups

This is my collection of writeups from ctfs that I've participated in.

I regularly compete with the University of Washington Security Team. We
call ourselves [Batman's Kitchen](http://uwctf.cs.washington.edu/)

[CTFTime Page](http://ctftime.org/team/3135/)

I only make writeups for problems that I can take most of the credit
for. In a CTF, I'll look at a lot of problems and contribute with my
teammates on many problems. These writeups are only for problems that I
really took the reins of.
