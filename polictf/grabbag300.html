<h1>PoliCTF Grab Bag 300</h1>

<p>Grab Bag 300 gives you an html file with embedded obfuscted javascript
and a picture of mr.hanky the christmas poo encoded in base64 in the
html file.</p>

<p>The embedded code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>eval(function( some parameters ) {
      e = function(c) {  Does some stuff }
      // some more code that returns text
    }(a huge wall of text for parameters));

)
</code></pre>

<p>Running the code causes this:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
</code></pre>

<p>The function e returns a base(a) encoding of c, where a is another
parameter given to the outside function as a whole, and c is the
parameter passed directly to e.</p>

<pre><code>e = function (c) {
    return (c &lt; a ? '' : e(parseInt(c / a))) + ((c = c % a) &gt; 35 ? String.fromCharCode(c + 29) : c.toString(36))
};
</code></pre>

<p>Observing in chrome has us notice that e calls e recursively up until
the point it breaks. Replace e with an iterative equivalent.</p>

<pre><code>e = function (c) {
    if(c == 0)
      return "0";
    remainder = c
    result = ""
    while (remainder &gt; 0) {
        temp = remainder
        result = ((temp = temp % a) &gt; 35 ? String.fromCharCode(temp + 29) : temp.toString(36)) + result;
        remainder = parseInt(remainder / a);
    }
    return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function call no longer breaks, but the eval on the returned code
causes a similar issue. The call stack size is exceeded, and it is from
e calling e. The eval broke. Take all of the text that the function
returned, and put it in an html file. It has some difference, but
redefines an e that does the same thing. Replace it again, because there
is actually another eval produced from that text.</p>

<p>Do this replacement of e one more time (so it's been replaced three
times total). Send that code through again and witness something totally
different. Now there is code not wrapped in eval that breaks.</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught ReferenceError: Arrray is not defined

<p>%s/Arrray/Array/g on the file and open this file:</p>

<p>I worked this out with five files:</p>

<ul>
<li>challenge.html - the original source</li>
<li>test1.html - A file that only has the script tag from challenge.html.
Replace recursive e with iterative e</li>
<li>test2.html - A file that has the text that the anonymous function in
test1.html returns. Replace recursive e with iterative e</li>
<li>test3.html - A file that has the text that the anonymous function in
test2.html returns. Replace recursive e with iterative e</li>
<li>test4.html - A file that has the text that the anonymous function in
test3.html returns. Search/Replace Arrray with Array</li>
</ul>
