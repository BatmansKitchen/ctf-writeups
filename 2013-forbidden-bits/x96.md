# Forbidden Bits X96 (150 Points)

Forbidden bits is a game. Initially, an IP and Port are given: `95.170.82.211:3000`.
Additionally, there is some message that says "Try to win the game".

Connecting to that socket starts the game.

        stupid captcha MSWJSBCQ

Can type the captcha to have it start presenting crap. Note that
whatever this outputs in the web browser is probably different from the
terminal, because many characters aren't cleanly printable in ASCII.
It's more clear in the terminal that this is **16 characters**.

        r9\yFi��Sv�????

I suppose that this is a puzzle of some sort. There's very little
direction to be immediately gained from this, so I just typed in random
crap and hit enter.

So clearly no points are earned. (This wasn't my original output, and
I've ommitted my input).

My plan was to probe the game a bit and gather samples of this text. so I
started to mash enter. Before I collected the samples, I encountered
something interesting like this:

        Your Score 0;
        +#*M+#*M+#*M????

The sequence, **+#*M**, shows up three times consecutively. It is
**four** characters long, and after there is a **four** character long
string of **????**. So... continue the pattern? I input the same four
characters.

        Your Score 0;
        +#*M+#*M+#*M????
        +#*M

        Your Score 1;

So following the pattern was definitely the right move. I try to keep
playing, but my failure on the next problem causes my score to revert to
0. But this is enough information to analyze the rest of the samples I
have! Some things that I know (or can sort of imply):

* I must enter a four character string to fill in the ????
* The 12 characters preceding the ??? are really **four blocks** of **three
  characters**
* **The ???? follows a pattern from the previous three chunks**, where that
  pattern is to just repeat the block if all three of the chunks are the
  same.

So, I'll analyze one of these problems:

        jC<3tMF=~WPG????

In some of the problems, not all of the symbols are printable. So I'll
get a hexdump of the whole thing.

        echo -en "jC<3tMF=~WPG????" | xxd -p
        6a433c33744d463d7e5750473f3f3f3f

It'd be best to separate this into separate clusters of four
characters. I also am throwing out the ???? to reduce distractions.

        6a433c33
        744d463d
        7e575047

I noticed that the differences in the least significant digit has the
same increment. That is,  **3 -> d is 10**, and **d -> 7 is 10**.
Playing with this, it turns out that [third line] - [second line] =
[second line] - [first line].

        744d463d - 6a433c33 = a0a0a0a
        7e575047 - 744d463d = a0a0a0a

It is worth considering that **[fourth line] = [third line] + [second
line] - [first line]**. That is, add the same increment to the third
value to get the ????. This turns out to be the answer.

         7e575047 + a0a0a0a = 88615a51

I need to transform this back into characters to enter this in.

        echo -en "88615a51" | xxd -p -r
        �aZQ

And it works.

Since it's not certain how many points are necessary to 'win' (I also
considered the possibility that the puzzle changes after a certain
point), I automated the process in ruby. Some things of note.

* My script uses a file called **game_output.txt** to store the game's output
  and the ruby program's input. I do this instead of pipes and file
  descripter redirecting for a few reasons:

    * I can in the game captcha manually
    * My ruby code does have to read the input as a stream.
    * I can tail game_output.txt in another terminal to monitor what is
      going on

* It is necessary to explicitly flush standard output after printing,
  because the game is interactive. (I spent a while frustrated with
  this small complication).


        # play_game.rb

        # Captcha
        puts gets()
        $stdout.flush()

        while true
          # Wait a little bit for input to come from the game
          sleep(1)

          # Read the game's most recent output into four strings
          file = open("game_output.txt")
          file.seek(file.size - 17) # 17 to account for \n
          data = []
          4.times { |index| data << file.read(4).chomp() }

          # Convert into 32 bit Big Endian
          int_data =  data.map{|d| d.unpack("N")}.flatten()

          # Compute the increment
          diff = int_data[2] - int_data[1]

          # Calculate the true int value of ????
          final = (int_data[2] + diff).to_s(16)

          # Convert to the ASCII version
          result = `echo -n #{final} | xxd -r -p`

          puts result
          $stdout.flush
        end

Then I ran the game with the following:

        ruby play_game.rb | nc 95.170.82.211 3000 > game_output.txt

The score goes up to 10, and the following gets dumped before the socket
gets closed.
