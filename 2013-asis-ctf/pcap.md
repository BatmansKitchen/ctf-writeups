# PCap

## Given

We're given a pcap file.

[The pcap file](pcap.pcap).

## Observations

There were two ip addresses communicating with each other:

* 172.16.133.133
* 172.16.133.149

## TCP Conversations

There was some substantial cover traffic, but in the end, we identified
just three categories of communication that were relevant:

* TCP Stream 0 -- Used as a just a chat apparently between the two users
  on either end.

    172.16.133.149: hello
    172.16.133.133: I need secret key
    172.16.133.149: ok
    172.16.133.149: secret key will be sent on 6 parts
    172.16.133.149: secret key : part 1 is M)m5s6S
    172.16.133.149: did you received part 1 of secret key?
    172.16.133.133: yes please send part 2
    172.16.133.149: part 2 of secret key is ^[>@#
    172.16.133.133: I recieved part 2
    172.16.133.133: ok. please send me the other parts too
    172.16.133.149: part 3 of secret key is Q3+1
    172.16.133.149: did you received part 3?
    172.16.133.133: yes
    172.16.133.149: are you ready to receive part 4?
    172.16.133.133: yes, please send
    172.16.133.149: part 4 is 0PD.
    172.16.133.133: ok. i received part 4
    172.16.133.133: Please send me part 5
    172.16.133.149: ok
    172.16.133.149: part 5 of secret key is KE#cy
    172.16.133.133: I received part 5
    172.16.133.149: part 6 of secret key is PsvqH
    172.16.133.133: ok. I received all parts of secret key.
    172.16.133.133: Thanx

* HTTP file transfers hitting various ports, but all HTTP, and all were
  172.16.133.133 requesting files from 172.16.133.149. These all
  requested files of filenames that were md5 hashes. For example:

    GET /files/d33cf9e6230f3b8e5a0c91a0514ab476

Additionally, The ASIS organizers realized that there was a bug in
problem in that they forgot to provide two files. These were
`053dc897d3e154dd5ed27c46b738850d` and `21eae902cf5b82c7b207e963a130856d`.

* An HTTP download of an Apache index page, where the contents of the
  index page all corresponded to files downloaded in the previously
  mentioned HTTP file transfers. Interestingly, those file transfers
  used ports and web servers that weren't apache.. this seems to just be
  something meant to confuse analysts. though. I've reproduced the table
  here in an ascii format.

## Some analysis

We noticed:

* One file, `d33cf9e6230f3b8e5a0c91a0514ab476`, had the magic number of
  a 7zip archive. It did not correctly decompress.
* One file, `c68cc0718b8b85e62c8a671f7c81e80a`, has a smaller filesize
  than the rest of the files.

We reasoned that all of these files could be blocks of a larger archive,
and that the smaller file is the trailing block at the end. Just on
speculation, we sorted the files by date last modified.

And it totally screamed to us, since the first file listed is the one
that was marked as a 7zip archive, and the last file here is the one
with the smaller filesize.

We extracted the files from the HTTP transfers and mashed them together
and tried to decompress them. We were prompted for a password, which we
then correlated to that other tcp stream that was the conversation. From
that, we ripped the key: `M)m5s6S^[>@#Q3+10PD.KE#cyPsvqH`. The archive
successfully decompressed, and there was a TIFF image with the flag.

![Pcap Flag Image](pcap_flag_image.tiff)

We saw this and were worried that there was going to be stego in this
image at this point, but thankfully we were wrong :).
